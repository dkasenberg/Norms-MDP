# Norms-MDP
This repository contains research code related to incorporating moral and social norms in linear temporal logic (LTL) for artificial agents in Markov Decision Processes.  It includes code pertaining to the following three papers:

* **[Norm Conflict Resolution in Stochastic Domains](https://hrilab.tufts.edu/publications/kasenbergscheutz18aaai.pdf)**
* **[Inverse Norm Conflict Resolution](https://hrilab.tufts.edu/publications/kasenbergscheutz18aies.pdf)**
* **[Interpretable Apprenticeship Learning with Temporal Logic Specifications](https://hrilab.tufts.edu/publications/kasenbergscheutz17cdc.pdf)**

The process of getting this ready for public sharing is ongoing, so this code is (1) poorly documented and (2) probably not runnable yet.  This wiki will be updated with installation and usage instructions.
